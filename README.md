This project aims to streamline the recruitment process by assisting recruiters with AI and enhancing workflow efficiency. Allowing recruiters to focus on client and candidate interactions.

Developed in isolation with Storybook for visual testing, components are thoroughly integrated and tested end-to-end using Jest and Cypress throughout the development cycle.
